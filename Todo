Frontend

* make frontend look decent
* other iecse designs can do similar https://www.figma.com/file/v9QEhA9OnSR5luEL64nHJu/IECSE-Main-website?node-id=0%3A1

* Response page and implementation corresponding to different response routes is left

*Admin dashboard is left
    *view responses of admin only formlist
    *create forms/ view only admin forms

* 404 page 
* link to register in login page and vice versa

* dropdown isnt working
* Also when both edit and multipleResponse is false then just one (i.e.very first) response is just possible or valid, but if a user wants to fill again it should show message something similar to what is comming from backend in that case
*we need copy button inside each form in admin/superadmin dashboard which will have something like this http://localhost:3000/form/60a5869152d95e761a715007 which can be used to share link of form 

Backend
* upload/download files,images,responses as csv
* sort/filter responses 
* testing
