FRONTEND
implement design
there is some bug in google login button for user response
create predefined templates for events we know  --- templates is done so now form just needs to be created with no delete option 
show message like requires editor access, form is closed, registration closed etc whereever required
delete option (admin side)
form input character limit, error color change
file upload  --- Not required for now
Templates in context
date picker needs styling  --- Horizontal scroll

Response DropDown not working in chrome
Templates remove closing time ,edit,permission,save etc
Show 1response /Total response for multiple response
Required not working -- on refresh required selection doesnt persists
Show required with star mark or something in response page
Option selection in response doesnt work on clicking circle 
decrease height of form response div
implement only single response with both edit and multiple as false
Owner shouldnt be shown in permission list
