Frontend
there is some bug in google login button for user response 
show message like requires editor access, form is closed, registration closed,verificaton email sent/verified etc whereever required
form input character limit, error color change
date picker needs styling
edit form button functionality
add section
open trashcan transition on delete
prevent first update in question list context
background blur
Complete Email verification frontend, make a fetch request when email sent is clicked to verify and after verificaton redirect to login 
file upload
form-admin page - redirect to responses or just change state?
dashboard search does not work
if delete form / template not allowed for an admin, don't keep delete button
painful question (unique key) instant update issue

BACKEND
sort response based on time ---> done i guess
timesramp for responses

single response / editabe / anonymous backend implementation (first check anonymous if false, check editable or not) , not able to fetch form or questions 
for anonymous form  ----> channged checkAuth middleware as implemented earlier seems working and  For where ever anonymous mark multipleresponse true and editable false
