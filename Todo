Frontend
there is some bug in google login button for user response
create predefined templates for events we know  --- templates is done so now form just needs to be created with no delete option 
show message like requires editor access, form is closed, registration closed,verificaton email sent/verified etc whereever required
form input character limit, error color change
date picker needs styling
edit form button functionality
add section
open trashcan trasnition on delete
prevent first update in question list context
text area adjust height according to content
background blur
non anonymous responses dropdown issue 

Complete Email verification frontend, make a fetch request when email sent is clicked to verify and after verificaton redirect to login 


BACKEND
sort response based on time ---> done i guess

reorder question backend implementation needed ---> Rhea

single response / editabe / anonymous backend implementation (first check anonymous if false, check editable or not) , not able to fetch form or questions 
for anonymous form  ----> channged checkAuth middleware as implemented earlier seems working and  For where ever anonymous mark multipleresponse true and editable false
