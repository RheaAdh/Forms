Frontend

there is some bug in google login button for user response
create predefined templates for events we know  --- templates is done so now form just needs to be created with no delete option 
show message like requires editor access, form is closed, registration closed etc whereever required
form input character limit, error color change
date picker needs styling
edit form button functionality
add section
open trashcan trasnition on delete
prevent first update in question list context
text area adjust height according to content
background blur
non anonymous responses dropdown issue 

BACKEND
option id  -- not needed
sort response based on time
response download - handle username, email (anonymous or not)

---NEED DETAILS(SAVED FOR LAST)---

reorder question backend implementation needed

single response / editabe / anonymous backend implementation (first check anonymous if false, check editable or not) , not able to fetch form or questions 
for anonymous form

editors list possibly contains superadmin id, shouldn't happen since superadmins have access to all forms
